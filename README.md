# Simulation_Infrastructure

# This infrastructure can be used to run Monte Carlo simulations of queueing systems.
# It allows for any number of stages in the queuing system, with any number of servers and as many customers as the user wishes

# The simulation can also work with any probability distribution provided by SciPy, and such probability distributions can be used to set how often customers arrive,
# how often servers go out of service, how long service time is, and how long servers will be out of service
